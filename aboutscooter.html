        <h1>
        Scott "Scooter" Caudle is a musician, editor, and designer <br> from Charlotte, North Carolina
        
        
        </h1>
    <p>
        I've grown up around music. from my humble beginnings as a toddler asking my mom for piano lessons
        to starting middle school and picking up a guitar, music has always had a spot in my life. 
        
        I have always had a do-it-yourself attitude and in 2013 I started a guitar pedal company called Mint Condition 
        Pedals. With the help of my father manning the drill press,  he drilled all of the enclosures and I wired 
        everything accordingly. I take great pride in creating utility pedals that help the average guitarist navigate
        their pedal board a little easier, while not breaking the bank. 
        <br>
        <br>
    Graduating from Gaston Christian School in 2014, I enjoyed 4 years of playing guitar for the praise band and loved 
        learning from the other musicians that I had the pleasure of playing with.  
  With my experiences as a musician, I have grown to love the creative process that comes along with that. 
        Whether its writing songs or setting up guitars, I always strive to my very best at anything that 
        is thrown my way. 
        <br>
        <br>
       Other interests besides music include editing media in different programs including After Effects, GIMP, and Photoshop. 
        I also am learning front end development, so I've gotten my feet wet in HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript. 
        <br>
        I have a passion for working with other people on musical projects and other creative ideas and I'd love to work with
        you!
